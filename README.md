# DTSaveManager
Demon Turf Save Manager (+ Neon Splash)

A Save Manager for the 2021 videogame Demon Turf, as well as the 2022 mini-sequel Demon Turf Neon Splash, developed by the indie studio Fabraz Inc. and published by Playtonic Friends.

This program creates a folder called _dtsm in Demon Turf's save directory, moves all existing save files to that folder, and swaps out the actual DTSaveData.txt with whichever file is marked as 'Active'. It also supports renaming files, locking files (to prevent accidental deletion), deleting files, and duplicating files. Currently supports Steam and GOG.

IMPORTANT! Please back up your important files BEFORE using this program.
